Install the Watchtower browser addon to get daily Gem rewards. Clear the trees and rocks from your city for a chance at extra gems. Do the Quests and Achievements.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Don't bother with defense at all until your TH (Town Hall) is level 10, just plunder enough for an upgrade then spend. Try to use shields to get the last TH upgrades.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Once your TH is level 10, upgrade your turrets first, then your walls.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Check out http://www.clashofclans-tools.com/Layouts/Top for inspiration -- Commanders of Evony is based on Clash of Clans. Keep in mind not all Clash of Clans mechanics are the same (e.g. there are no \"spring traps\" in CoE).</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Build a buffer of non-essential buildings in front of your turrets to soak up damage while your turrets deal some damage. The best buffer buildings are Rally Spots, Barracks, Hall of War, Academy. You should also use mines and farms as buffers, as the majority of your resources are not stored in these.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Make sure your AoE turrets (Wizard Towers, Catapults) are protected, but not too close to the center. They deal AREA damage, and are therefore most effective when the enemy has the most troops still alive.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Don't make your base a square shape, as it will be weak at the corners.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Don't put turrets too close together, as Spartacus Leaps and Sweeps will be able to take out multiple turrets with each attack.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Don't put your stores too close together. Make it so the attacker will have to clear your base completely to get all 4 coin stores. So not too close to edge, but not too close to center.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Put your Alliance Castle near the center of your base. Try to stock it with ranged units who won't be instantly destroyed when they come out to defend your base (again, the concept of buffering).</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Try and find the sweet spot between a spread out base (good for wearing attackers down as their units have to keep moving a lot while taking fire, but easily breached) and a compact base (great for maximum fire coverage/overlap from your turrets).</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Break up the inside of your base into compartments, so if one wall section is breached, the enemy units still have to break through to get to other parts. (Not as effective against Houyi attackers with range maxed).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Levelling your generals</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Save up those Double General EXP's you win from casino and use them to power level generals that are a lot below your level.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Start an alt and make your own training city; port it near your main city so you can attack it on the map. Easy EXP with no revenge attacks. Training cities are also useful for testing your main city defenses.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>To get Soul Gems: Delevel your honor by attacking in Match with Spartacus (just do a single Sweep then Exit battle) until he's out of energy. Then attack in Match with the General you need Soul Gems for in the 50-150 Honor range. You might want to wait till you have 5<li>Wizards for maximum efficiency. Rumour has it destroying a city with as few units as possible increases chance of a Soul Gem a little, but I have not tested this! Small cities give just as many Gems as cities your level.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Do those Kingdom Orders. Prioritise Orders according to whether you want to spend stars or not. The amount of units you need to build per Order goes up as you level up.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Plundering tactics</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Raid players in Match around the 400-600 Honor range (this tends to vary, but below 1000 has generally the best targets).</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Try to find players who have put their Coin Stores in bad places, close enough to raid them without having to destroy their whole city. Houyi with Wizards or Archers works great for this.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Don't bother plundering Goods, you'll end up with plenty of them without trying if you just keep attacking. Resist the temptation to hit cities with a huge stockpile, just keep clicking Next till you find a high-Coin target.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
